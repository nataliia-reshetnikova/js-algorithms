<h1>Divide and Conquer - countZeroes</h1>
<p>Given an array of 1s and 0s which has all 1s first followed by all 0s, write a function called countZeroes, which returns the number of zeroes in the array.</p>

```
countZeroes([1,1,1,1,0,0]) // 2
countZeroes([1,0,0,0,0]) // 4
countZeroes([0,0,0]) // 3
countZeroes([1,1,1,1]) // 0
```

<p>Time Complexity - O(log n)</p>
