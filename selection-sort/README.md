<h2>Selection Sort Pseudocode</h2>

<ul>
<li>Store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.</li>
<li>Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.</li>
<li>If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum" and continue until the end of the array.</li>
<li>If the "minimum" is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values.v
Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Time complexity: O(n*n)</p>
